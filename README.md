# AM2500 DOCUMENTATION REPO

This GitHub repository contains the documentation about the AMSynths 2500 analog synthesizer that is a replica of the ARP 2500 synthesizer from 1970.

There is documentation and open source for each AMSynths module:
* Short form Project Notes
* Eagle CAD schematics and board layouts
* Configuration and setup instructions
* 5U Panel CAD files
* Photographs of the completed modules

The AMSynths website at https://amsynths.co.uk/home/my-synths/2500-rack/ contains more detail on the build status and outcomes and has links to the audio and video demos.

If you need the original schematics go to https://guitarfool.com/ARP2500.html or purchase them from Music Parts at https://www.musicparts.com/products.asp?Company=Arp. I will not be posting the original schematics here.
